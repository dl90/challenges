# Ethical Theories

morality: societies rule of conduct
ethics: rational examination of moral believes

## Ethical relativism

no universal moral norms of right and wrong

1. subjective relativism: individuals creates their own morals/decide whats right/wrong themselves
1. cultural relativism: societies views on right/wrong, varies between place and time

## Others

1. divine command theory: right/wrong based on religion and scripture
1. ethical egotism: right/wrong based exclusively on self interest

### Workable

1. kantianism: based on good will, dutifulness over desire, do what you want others to do (will motivating the action)
    * imperative: reason commands will
    * hypothetical imperative: the means to achieve a goal
    * categorical imperative: unconditional rule (moral imperative)
        * first formulation: universalize add check for contradictions to evaluate moral rules
        * second formulation: not a means to an end, not using people to achieve a goal
    * perfect/imperfect duties: obligated to fulfill every instance/in general
    * perfect duties prevails over imperfect duties (wrong to steal bread to feed your starving child)
1. act utilitarianism: action is good if benefits exceeds harm, vice versa
    * consequentialist theory: focuses on consequence of action
    * problem of moral luck: unforeseen consequences of a good act may result to something negative
1. rule utilitarianism: adopt moral rules that benefits all when everyone participates (consequences of the action)
1. social contract theory: set of moral rules to govern and a government capable of enforcing these rules
    * negative right: others guarantee you are free to act without being bothered (absolute)
    * positive right: others are obligated to do on/for your behalf (limited)
    * tragedy of the commons: individuals exploit benefits from burden shared by the community
1. virtue ethics: focuses on the person rather than the act or consequence
    * intellectual virtue: associated with reasoning and truth
    * moral virtue (virtue of character): habits and disposition from repetition of virtuous actions

Ethical objectivism: morality exists beyond the human mind, people are responsible for discovering it
