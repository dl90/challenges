Professional developers ought to be accountable for their code and should proactively look for/resolve any issues that may occur. It is not always possible to identify issues so plans should be in place to handle unforeseen problems down the line. Consult knowledgeable seniors when possible and stay up to date.

When dealing with conflicts between professional responsibilities, personal ethics and the law, laws should be followed. If any task for a job strongly conflicts with one's personal ethics due to the possibility of causing harm or if it's morally wrong, it is best to pursue an alternative. Otherwise, do your job.

### Information Privacy

When dealing with private information in use cases where there are currently no laws or regulations in place, developers should still handle the information with caution. It is important to identify the intended use of the information, if itâ€™s collection is necessary, and check with the local government and your users if they agree to how the information is collected and used.

Match privacy regulations with the type of personal information you are collecting. Watch for jurisdiction overlap between local, federal privacy laws and international agreements. Be on alert to changes in privacy laws and consult a lawyer when appropriate.

### Work and Wealth

Environmental impact in IT stems mostly from hardware. This is inevitable as new generation hardware outperforms the old and as industry standards move forward, companies will have to update to stay competitive. This obsolescence generates a lot of e-waste. What IT professionals can do is to consider the service life and future-proofness of a piece of hardware prior to procurement. For software, IT professionals should ensure things are running efficiently and resources are not being wasted on trivial processes.

Developers at the forefront of AI development should think about the broad effects of its usage and consider if it benefits the general public or a select few.
There is little that IT professionals can do about the digital divide caused by wealth inequality. One way to help is to ensure things are accessible and well documented, making the transition for new users easier.

### Networked Communications

Web developers play an important role between users and the web because we build the interfaces that allow for interactions on the web. It is our professional responsibility to ensure the things we built are clear and not misleading to users.

Knowing the possible dangers on the web, we should keep an eye on how data is being handled during all stages of development and suggest alternatives to minimize when possible. We should push for ways to inform clients and users to identify if the source of information is organic or tailored, and push companies to be transparent on how information is processed before reaching the end users.

The tech giants are a challenge as much of the web is integrated and maintained on their infrastructure, and most of the innovation stems from them. Any changes will have to rely on government regulations driven by public sentiment.
