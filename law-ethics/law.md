eg. Criminal law is under Federal jurisdiction, only the Federal government can amend it, but it is enforced by both provincial and federal police (VPD/RCMP)

Three branches of government with law making powers:

* Legislative branch: creates legislation or statutes (makes laws)
* Judicial branch: interprets legislation and makes case law (judicate cases, render decision, solve disputes)
* Executive branch: runs the country/province, implements the law (heads of federal/provincial government)

Legislative branch includes Parliament and Legislative Assembly

* statutes (legislation)

Judicial branch are federally appointed justices and provincial judges
