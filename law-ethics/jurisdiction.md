## Common Law System

> origins: peoples customs/traditions, Roman law (property rights), Church (family and estate), merchants (guilds/unions)

Judgement from the common law system is bound by precedent with the following:

* case must be in the same jurisdiction
* precedent must be a decision from a higher court
* must be based on substantially similar facts

## Judicature Acts (1873 - 1875)

Court of Chancery (Common law) merged with Court of Equity

The two bodies of laws are separate (you can plead both Common Law and Equity at the same court)

Common law uses Common law precedents | Equity law uses Equity law precedents
