1. copyright: protection for authors of original works, only when it is in a tangible form ``` (ideas are not copyrighted until it is in physical form) ```
1. trademark: word, name or symbol used to indicate the brand/ownership of a product or service ``` (helps consumers identify brands) ```
1. patent: exclude others from making, using, selling a patented invention ``` (process/method of manufacturing or design of a product is protected) ```
1. trade secret: valuable info granting its holders advantage over their competitors ``` (KFC secret recipe, not patented due to patent expiration and lookup) ```

trademarks:

* last indefinitely as long as it is used and doses not become generic
* ® for registered, TM or SM for unregistered, lasts 10 years and is renewable

patents:

* lasts 20 years for utility (process/product)
* lasts 14 years for designs

## Copyright for Website and Software

* software is protected (some countries allow software patent) generally by copyright
* video games is protected by copyright

> derivative works: work based on preexisting works (movie based on book), require the concent of the original author

works for hire: employee of company with copyright works, life of author + 95 years

Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA, American): extends copyright by 20 years, heavily lobbied by Disney

expired copyright becomes *public domain*, where anyone can use without author concent or have to pay licencing fee/royalties

## Copyright Notice

not mandatory, no need to publish notice, as long as work is tangible

recommended to have a copyright notice ``` Name © year ``` to inform others of original and protected work

### registration is voluntary, but should be done as best practice

* legal action requires the plaintiff to hold registered copyright
* copyright law permits copyright holder to seek statutory damages (amount awarded is stipulated in the statute)
* establishes public record of creator/owner of original work
* actual damages suffered (non registered copyright award for damages, which is difficult to assess/prove) typically is less than statutory damages

> IP is **national** in scope, international protection requires following the requirements and filing for protection in each individual country

## Fair Use Defense

using parts of original works for the purposes of critique, comment, news, teach/research

1. purpose and character of the use (commercial = difficult to defend)
1. nature of the copyrighted work (factual vs fictional, fictional = difficult to defend)
1. amount of work used (quantity, quality, importance)
1. economic impact of use for the copyright holder (less = better defense)

transformative use: use differs from original use such that the meaning/message is new (parody)

> First Sale Doctrine: can resale/gift licensed products if it was already legitimately purchased
