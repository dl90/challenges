      Thanks to your support, our team has been busy gathering and analyzing
      test data from the current open beta. If there are no new serious bugs, we
      expect to release this sometime in the second quarter next year. In the
      mean time, we will be peforming an stress test on the servers next week
      from
      <b>December 16th, to December 20th</b>. The tests will start on midnight
      and we expect them to last for 5 hours until <b>5AM</b> the following day.
