# Webpage

site objectives:

* traffic/visitors
  * revenue: ads (publishers, news, social media)
  * source: paid (traffic adds) organic (*direct*: url, *referral*: link, *search listing*: google)

* conversions: get users to do something (call for action)
  * micro: newsletter, commenting, sharing
  * macro: membership, premium account

* revenue:
  * up-sell/cross-sell
  * customer loyalty (retention less expensive than acquisition)

## Landing page

Dedicated landing page paired to specific marketing campaigns

### Purpose

1. Capture leads: getting email addresses/personal info (lead generating page)

1. Warm up potential customers on product/provide additional info (click through page)

Netflix landing page: one call to action, join for a free month (new members)

> Attention ratio: specific desired action vs number of actions available (1:1 is best)
>
> Message matching: Ad header matches with redirected landing page

### Landing page vs Home page

home page: general purpose, promote exploration, full of links

landing page: single purpose, single call to action/link

### Considerations

* same message between add campaign and landing page
* minimize user input, simplify form
* simple, navigable
* mobile friendly, load time
* call to action/value proposition above the fold, everything else below
* thankyou page/message following user conversion
* SEO

## Microsite

site outside of main site's domain, targeting sub-segment of primary market

campaign specific and temporary (buzzworthy/creative)
