# Market Segmentation Process

people who want cars, but different types of cars

* Benefit segmentation: based on benefits the consumer gains from product

* Usage segmentation: based on how often consumers use the product

* Behavioral segmentation: based on user personality/behavior traits

## targeting

* Undifferentiated strategy: whole market, focuses on consumer similarities rather than differences (large overhead/ineffective)

* Concentrated strategy: few products for few segments of market, all in, difficult to transition later

* Differentiated strategy: several products for different segments of market (medium overhead)

## product positioning

the instance when marketers create the product offering such that consumers attention is brought over from the competitors

* Consumer positioning: satisfying specific needs

* Competitive positioning: distinguish product from competitors (direct/indirect comparison, which may backfire)

> *majority fallacy* : large market segments draws large competition, may be more profitable/lucrative to chase the smallest slice of pie
