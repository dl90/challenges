* segments: subset of total data
* goal: specifics on how to accomplish objectives
* targets: numerical values defined as indicators of success/failure

at least 5 KPI to justify findings

activity != outcome || visits != sales

* conversion

### Audience (who came)

* geographic location
* visited previously
* frequency of revisit
* device used

### Acquisition (source of visitors)

* channels driving most visits
* sites redirecting to your site
* campaigns driving most visits
* impact of 'earned', 'owned', 'paid'

### Behavior (visitor attention)

* which pages
* entry and exit points
* search queries
* actions taken/what they did

### Conversion (success?)

* realized transaction rate
* drop-out rate
