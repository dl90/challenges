# Target market

good to be specific but don't fixate on one specific group, there may be multiple.

product/service should also accommodate wider demographics if possible

## assess current customer base

1. why do they buy from you
1. common characteristics/interests
1. what group brings the most business
1. how are they using/benefiting from your product/service

## assess competition customer base

1. who are their current customers
1. who are they targeting/not targeting

## Market Segmentation Process

people who want cars, but different types of cars

* Benefit segmentation: based on benefits the consumer gains from product
* Usage segmentation: based on how often consumers use the product
* Behavioral segmentation: based on user personality/behavior traits

### targeting

* Undifferentiated strategy: whole market, focuses on consumer similarities rather than differences (large overhead/ineffective)
* Concentrated strategy: few products for few segments of market, all in, difficult to transition later
* Differentiated strategy: several products for different segments of market (medium overhead)

### product positioning

the instance when marketers create the product offering such that consumers attention is brought over from the competitors

* Consumer positioning: satisfying specific needs
* Competitive positioning: distinguish product from competitors (direct/indirect comparison, which may backfire)

> *majority fallacy* : large market segments draws large competition, may be more profitable/lucrative to chase the smallest slice of pie
