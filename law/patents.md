* patent applications following publications relating to patents (papers) are given 1 years time (first publication date), after witch becomes 'prior art' (non-obvious)
* provisional patents can be applied during research to avoid publications becoming 'prior art'

note:

* 'prior art': [knowledge, usage, patents, description] related to an existing invention (already known)
* Anticipation: invention is already known/used locally, or is patented/described in a publication locally or internationally
* anticipated inventions are not novel
