# OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model

1. application: application API requests
1. presentation: character encoding, encryption and compression
1. session: open and close connection between devices
1. transport: chucking and packaging data for transfer, manages transmission speed and handles transport errors
1. network: identifies path for cross network data transfer (routing and traffic control)
1. data link: node to node data transfer, identifies access through MAC address (within private network)
1. physical: transfer of raw data (stream of bits) over wire
